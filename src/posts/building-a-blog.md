Eventually, I would love to share my thoughts on work, life, and many other things. Until then, here is a picture of me trying to squish an elephant on a safari in Kruger National Park, South Africa. If you've never been on a safari I would highly recommend it, especially with [&Beyond](https://www.andbeyond.com/our-lodges/africa/south-africa/kruger-national-park/ngala-private-game-reserve/andbeyond-ngala-safari-lodge/).


Please [email me](mailto:dantilse@gmail.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dantilse/) if you would like to connect.
